In the [hacker culture][1]{:target="_blank"}, a hacker is a computer expert who enjoys to achieve novel and clever outcomes by engaging in programming tasks in a spirit of exploration.

In order to blog like a hacker, you should write posts in a smart, original, effortless, and enjoyable way, possibly using [open-source][2]{:target="_blank"} software.

This is what I do: I write posts on plain text files, and then build the final HTML pages with [Jekyll][3]{:target="_blank"}; everything from the command-line.

If you are a complete beginner, you should first [get familiar with the command-line][4]{:target="_blank"}, and then learn a little bit about [Git][5]{:target="_blank"}, and also [GitHub][6]{:target="_blank"}.

After that, you'll be ready to host your blog on [GitHub Pages][7]{:target="_blank"}, for free!
