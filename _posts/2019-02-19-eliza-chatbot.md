[ELIZA][1]{:target="_blank"} is a chatbot that emulates the behaviour of a psychotherapist. You can have fun talking to her about your problems within the most powerful Linux text editor [Emacs][2]{:target="_blank"}, which is open source software and is also available for Windows and macOS.

From the editor, you do `ALT`+`x` then type `doctor` and hit return. This is the beginning of a conversation I recently had with her.

> I am the psychotherapist. Please, describe your problems.
>
> Hello, I'm Massimo.
>
> How do you do? What brings you to see me?
>
> I feel frustrated. Can't find ideas on what to write about. I think I've got the writer's block.
>
> Are you frustrated often?
>

Developed in 1966 at MIT, ELIZA is claimed to be the first computer program that passed the [_Turing test_][3]{:target="_blank"} as it fooled some people into believing they were talking to a real person.

Please keep in mind that ELIZA isn't supposed to provide serious psychotherapy. Seek professional advice in order to improve your mental health.
