It takes as little as to write the command [_fortune_][1]{:target="_blank"} within the startup script [_.bashrc_][2]{:target="_blank"}, which is a hidden text file in the home folder.

All we get is to see some funny sayings every time we open up a Bash shell.

First, let's install fortune and try it.

```
$ sudo apt-get install fortune
```

```
$ fortune
You'll never see all the places, or read all the books, but fortunately,
they're not all recommended.
```

Second, put the command `fortune` to the last line of .bashrc using _nano_ or any other text editor.

```
$ nano $HOME/.bashrc
```

## Make it Funnier

Let's install [_cowsay_][3]{:target="_blank"}, and make it work together with fortune.

```
$ sudo apt-get install cowsay
```

```
$ fortune | cowsay

```

You can also change the _cow_ by using the `-f` option with one of the following _cowfiles_:

```
apt bud-frogs bunny calvin cheese cock cower daemon default dragon dragon-and-cow duck elephant elephant-in-snake eyes flaming-sheep fox ghostbusters gnu hellokitty kangaroo kiss koala kosh luke-koala mech-and-cow milk moofasa moose pony pony-smaller ren sheep skeleton snowman stegosaurus stimpy suse three-eyes turkey turtle tux unipony unipony-smaller vader vader-koala www
```

For example, let's use the `duck`.

```
fortune | cowsay -f duck

```

Finally, let's pick random cows!

```
$ fortune | cowsay -f `ls /usr/share/cowsay/cows/ | shuf | head -n 1`

        |m|   |m| 
```
